# Code Style: Beautiful Code Principles

## Forking a repository

To make the copy of a repository, click on the Fork button in the upper right corner of the repository page. This will produce the duplicate of the project in your GitHub account. If you don't have an account, create it.

## Cloning a repository

Open the Repositories tab on your GitHub page and select the repository you forked on the previous stage. Click on the Code button in the right part of the page:

You will see the window where you can copy the repository address. It'll be necessary for cloning. Now open the command prompt and move to the folder where you're going to save the repository. Enter the git clone command and the address of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/THE_NAME_OF_YOUR_ACCOUNT_HERE/code-style-and-effective-work-in-ide-code-style.git
```

## Importing a project into IDEA

Select the Open or Import item in the dialogue at the IDEA start-up.

In the appeared dialogue window for opening files, choose the folder with the cloned repository and click on the Open button. Pay attention that you need to open the entire directory. After this, the project will be added to IntelliJ IDEA.
